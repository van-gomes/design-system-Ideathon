# Roche UI Framework

Roche Design System

The Roche UI Framework is Roche’s official Design System, developed to ensure visual consistency, development efficiency and global scalability. With a focus on accessibility, performance and usability, it offers a robust foundation of design tokens, reusable components and integrated documentation, allowing teams across different countries and Roche products to share a unified visual language.

More than a library of components, the Roche UI Framework is a strategic infrastructure that accelerates Roche’s digital transformation, reduces rework, standardizes deliveries and ensures a high-quality user experience across all digital fronts of the organization.
